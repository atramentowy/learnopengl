# LearnOpenGl projects

Projects I created while learning OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com/

### Each project can be built with CMake

You will have to add additional libraries such as GLFW and assimp if the project requires it

```bash
  cd path/to/project
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build .
```
